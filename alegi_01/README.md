For this assignment I used the examples given in the class github to serve as my base, and then used Mozilla tutorials as well. The Mozilla tutorials were helpful for my transitions and refining the CSS, because I initially had a lot of difficulty getting started. Additionally, I watched a few Youtube videos on transitions to get a feel for what each property represented. I did not use any AI at all to complete this assignment, and overall found it to be challenging since I hadn't done a project like this by myself before.
